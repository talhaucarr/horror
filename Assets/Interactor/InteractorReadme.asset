  - heading: Thank You!
    text: So you're here! It means you spent your money on my software (I suppose),
      imported in your project and ready to use. I'm glad that you did and it feels
      really good to have real people after spending too much time alone. You'll find
      everything you need below and if you cant, feel free to ask.

  - heading: Setup for Interactor
    text: "No need to worry for setup because Interactor needs so little to change
      in your project. \n\n1 - Add \"Player\" layer to your Layers (Top right of Editor)
      and assign your player to that layer. This is for preventing conflicts while
      spawning new prefabs or selecting distance objects with raycasts. \n\n2 - Change
      your Color Space to Linear on \"Project Settings > Player > Color Space\". This
      is for getting some materials to look correct in example scenes. It is not necessary
      otherwise. \n\nSoon, there will be a feedback survey here for customer satisfaction,
      needs, integrations, etc. In the meantime, experience the Interactor, its better
      to participate later."

  - heading: Integrations and Examples
    text: "Currently there are three versions of Interactor. When you import, it comes
      with DefaultPack (InteractorIK) and you can convert between DefaultPack and
      FinalIKPack (Final IK integration) on the Interactor component at any time.
      \n\nAlso there is CorePack which has only core features without any example
      scripts. \n\nBut DO NOT run these packs by yourself, use Interactor (add Interactor
      to any scene object and select at Integrations section). Because some files
      need to be deleted and Interactor handles that for you. \n\nAlso do not delete
      the Examples folder because it has example scripts tied with Interactor core
      scripts. If you don't need examples, use Interactor's Delete Examples button
      to convert Core version.\n\nInteractor comes with default 2K textures because
      of file sizes but all textures are actually in 4K resolution. If you want to
      use 4K versions, you can download and import the 4K texture pack. Just import
      the pack and it's done without any tweaks."

  - heading: QuickStart
    text: "I strongly suggest you examine the Example Scenes first if you didn't yet.
      There are samples for every interaction types with additional info. Also, there
      are lots of comments on codes to explain most of the things. \n\nHere is a quick
      guide for testing your first interactions with your own character: \n\n1- Add
      Interactor to the player character (It will also add sphere collider if there
      isn't any) \n\n2- Set sphere collider as a trigger. Increase its radius to cover
      the whole character. Edit its center if you need fine adjustments (only Y-axis
      in most cases). \n\n3- Interactor comes with Default InteractorIK, if you wish
      to use Final IK, select Final IK on the integrations section on the Interactor
      component. You can switch between them any time you want. \n\n4- Click Start
      Interactor button and it will add your first Effector. \n\n5- Effectors are
      like interaction sensors (one for each interactable player part). Add many as
      you need ([ + ] [ - ] buttons), then adjust their parameters. You can copy parameters
      and paste to another Effector with Copy/Paste buttons. When you add a new effector,
      Interactor is going to ask you for a save file. Create a new one, it will be
      used for prefab lists. \n\n6- If you want to ignore player triggers/colliders
      on design (Editor) and on interactions (Runtime) add your character to the Player
      layer. Raycasts will ignore that layer. \n\n7- If you're using the Default InteractorIK
      version, add InteractorIK component to your character. Set your IK Parts for
      each interactable body part. Set durations to 2, Multiplier For Second Halfs
      to 1 and select Match Children Bones if you wish to animate its child bones.
      \n\n8- If you're using the Final IK version, you need to make proper setup for
      Final IK (It's own setup). See details on Online Documentation. \n\n9- Find
      your Effector bones on your character skeleton rig (interactable body parts
      like Left Hand, Right Foot, etc), copy them, add InteractorTarget.cs to each
      one of them, set their Effector Type and Match Children Bones options. Make
      prefabs each one of them separately (Select in the hierarchy and drag it in
      any folder). You can delete them now in the scene because we only need prefabs.
      \n\n10- Open Interactor again and click the Spawner Window button to open Interactor
      Target Spawner. Assign prefabs to the main prefab slot for each effector that
      you want to use. Do not close the spawner window, you can dock it on any tab
      of Unity editor (After all prefabs added, save the scene to save prefab list).
      Activate the Add Required Components option. \n\n11- Create a 3D Object in scene
      (Cube etc). Right-click on it at scene view to spawn desired prefabs (Interactor
      Target Spawner window must stay open for scene view menus). \n\n12- Create empty
      GameObject, add BasicUI.cs and PlayerState.cs components. Assign player to Player
      Object field on PlayerState.cs component. \n\n13- Add BasicInputInteract.cs
      component to player. \n\n14- Play and interact. If your effector parameters
      and spawned target match, when your character in the right position you should
      able to interact. See Online Documentation and tutorial videos for more details."

    text: "I'm a solo indie developer and developing my own game for the last 2 years
      without any income (with savings from my last job, well, which is zero now).
      I'm also using this tool in my game and that\u2019s why I made it for public
      use, to continue my development. I put a lot of effort into this tool and still,
      there is plenty of room for improvement, which is going to carry this tool to
      the next level (I hope). \n\n\xBBYou can read my future vision on online documentation.
      \n\nSo if you're satisfied and want to support this tool, I\u2019d appreciate
      if you leave ratings & comments on the store page. If you're not satisfied,
      reach me out and I'll do my best to help. Thank you. \n\n-razz"
